### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Before (v3.3.x) | After (v3.4.0) | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| First search result | 5-10s | 1-3s | 70-80% faster |
| Cached search | N/A | <100ms | Instant |
| Audio URL (fast method) | 5-10s | <1s | 90%+ faster |
| Audio URL (standard) | 5-10s | 2-3s | 50-60% faster |
| Stream initialization | 5-10s | 1-2s | 80% faster |
| Batch audio URLs (5 items) | 25-50s | ~2s | 92% faster |

### Migration Notes

#### New Methods
```dart
// Ultra-fast audio URL fetching (requires video ID)
final result = await api.getAudioUrlFast(videoId: 'dQw4w9WgXcQ');

// Batch fetch multiple audio URLs
final urls = await api.getAudioUrlsFastBatch(
  videoIds: ['video1', 'video2', 'video3'],
);

// Search with caching (enabled by default)
final results = await api.searchMusic(
  query: 'Blinding Lights',
  useCache: true, // Can be disabled if needed
);

// Stream with progress tracking
await for (final result in api.streamSearchResults(
  query: 'The Weeknd',
  onProgress: (processed, total) {
    print('Progress: $processed/$total');
  },
)) {
  // Handle result
}

// Cache management
api.clearCache(); // Clear all cache
api.clearCacheForQuery('specific query'); // Clear specific query
final stats = api.getCacheStats(); // Get cache statistics
```

#### Breaking Changes
- None. All changes are backward compatible.

#### Recommended Updates
- Consider using `getAudioUrlFast()` instead of `getAudioUrlFlexible()` when video ID is known
- Enable caching for frequently searched queries to improve user experience
- Use batch methods when fetching multiple audio URLs simultaneously

### Developer Notes

#### Python Backend
- Added `get_audio_url_fast()` method to `YTMusicSearcher` class
- Implemented `_process_search_batch_parallel()` for concurrent processing
- Added `_album_art_cache` dictionary for thumbnail URL caching
- Optimized `get_music_details()` generator for immediate yielding

#### Kotlin Layer
- Implemented `handleGetAudioUrlFast()` with 3-second maximum timeout
- Optimized `SearchStreamHandler` with reduced timeouts and parallel processing
- Added `prewarmSearchEngine()` for cold-start mitigation
- Cached executor pools at class level for reuse

#### Dart Interface
- Added caching layer with `_searchCache` and `_cacheTimestamps` maps
- Implemented cache management utilities
- Enhanced progress tracking for streaming methods
- Added batch processing support for audio URLs

### Known Limitations

- Cache is in-memory only and cleared on app restart
- Fast audio URL method doesn't support quality selection (uses best available)
- Batch audio URL fetching has a rate limit safety delay of 100ms between batches
- Cache size limited to 50 entries to prevent excessive memory usage


## [3.3.7]

`Active & Working`

### Updated
- Updated the internal python plugin versions with :
  ("yt-dlp==2025.12.08", "ytmusicapi==1.11.4")
  <!-- as of december 2025 -->

## [3.3.6]

`EOL`

### Added

- Introduced `streamRadio` method to fetch dynamic radio playlists.  
  This method provides real-time, frequently updated radio streams based on evolving algorithms.

### Fixed

- Updated internal `yt-dlp` dependency from `2025.06.30` to `2025.07.21`.  
  Previous versions (`<=2025.06.30`) are no longer supported by this plugin and may result in audio extraction failures.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Plugins using older `yt-dlp` versions will fail due to breaking changes in upstream audio extraction logic. Ensure your dependencies reflect the updated version for compatibility.

[3.3.5]

`NOT Working`

## Added

- Added a method `getAudioUrlFlexible` which gives a single result for audiourl based on either `Title/Artist` or `videoId` 

## Fixed

- Minor fixes to `get_audio_url` added code if the selected quality wasn't found the engine will autoselect the best available.

[3.3.4]

`Active & Working`

## Fixed

- Minor fixes to `handleInitialization`, `get_audio_url`.


[3.3.3]

`Active & Working`

## Fixed

- Minor Patches to `handleInitialization`, `handlePythonInitialization`, `handleDispose`
- Fixed the results mixup issues by properly improving cancellations

[3.3.2]

`Active & Working`

## Fixed

- Ensured robust per-search cancellation by tracking and checking the latest active search ID for each stream type.

- Added a final guard in both Kotlin and Python to prevent yielding or emitting results from any previous/cancelled stream.

- Eliminated edge-case race conditions that could allow items from a canceled query to appear in a new search stream.

- Unified cancellation handling across all stream handlers to guarantee only current query results reach the client.[3.3.1]

## Added

- Finalized generator-safe StreamHandlers for:

- SearchStreamHandler

- RelatedSongsStreamHandler

- ArtistSongsStreamHandler

- SongDetailsStreamHandler
- These handlers now integrate global stream cancellation rules, ensuring only the latest active stream is allowed to emit items.

- Active generator identity verification using isLatestOfType(...) and has(...) in SearchManager to prevent late emissions from stale generators.

- Stream-safe coroutine helpers that fully honor onCancel() and avoid generator.__close__ errors during rapid query changes.

## Fixed

- 🛡️ 1% race condition that allowed a stale item ("my strange addiction") from a previous generator after switching to a new stream (e.g. "Dance Monkey"). This was eliminated by protecting both:

- 🔎 Kotlin: Before delivering items to Flutter (events.success(...))

- 🧠 Python: Before yield within generator, via inspector.is_active(...) guards

- ✂️ Removed useless variables like generatorRegistered = true from Kotlin, which were unused and showing linter warnings.

- 🧹 Prevented cancellation log spam:

- Used searchManager.has(searchId) before calling cancelSearch(...) to avoid:

- 🔄 Fixed Python generators still running yield after close attempt:

- Now intercepted precisely before results are sent in Kotlin and Python.

## Improved

- ✅ Flutter cancellation consistency: Only the latest searchId per stream type (search, related, artist, details) is now allowed to run or emit.

- ⚠ Better log annotations in Kotlin and Python, including:

- PythonEngineInspector: Yield guard check

- YTMusicAPI: Skipping stale result from cancelled stream

- Final StopIteration handling and shutdown trace for debugging

- 🚫 Suppressed Generator does not support __close__ warning by properly handling fallback GeneratorExit in Python

## [3.2.1]

`NOT_WORKING-EOM`

### Added

- Added proper streaminghandlers for (search, related songs, artist songs, song details)
- Added support for Lyrics from YTMUSIC request to `YtFlutterMusicapi.fetchLyrics(songName, AristName)` no time synced only.

- Improved backpressure handling for slow clients

### Breaking Changes

- `(New)streamArtistSongs` now requires explicit cancellation handling

- Generator-based APIs may throw StopIteration exceptions

- Stream order is no longer guaranteed to match original API

### Migration Notes

- Clients should implement proper stream cancellation

- Batch processing now requires explicit collection of stream items of this package!

- Error handling should account for mid-stream failures
